## Simple landing page

> #### Variant 3
>
> Design template link: https://www.figma.com/file/vwiwu6GnDphlI25vncvl3F/LabWork1-V3
### Description: Create a landing page following the given design in Figma.

#### Requirements:

- [x] Use of semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<footer>`, etc.) wherever is necessary
- [x] All fonts, colour palette, elements sizes must strictly match the design.
- [x] Pixel perfect is also not required, BUT your website should visually match the design template (i.e. If the element is horizontally centred on the design, it should look centred on the website)
- [x] All class names must not be meaningless (i.e. `class="myClass"`) and should follow the same naming convention, preferably BEM, but you could come up with your own (just be consistent)
- [x] Basic cross-browser support (website should look correctly on last versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)

For now, responsiveness is not required.

> An example website is also provided (from Live coding): https://github.com/NazarGorokhivskiy/LandingForLiveCoding

## Changes in lab

In the process of performing laboratory work, I noticed several shortcomings of the template given to me, therefore, on my own initiative, I decided to change several design elements

#### 1. In order to improve the look of the website and deepen my knowledge, I decided to implement dark mode for this work. It can be turned on and off using the toggle switch in the upper right corner of the page

#### 2. The photo on the main section of the site was of poor quality and also contained a white background, which does not look good in dark mode

> I decided to replace it with another high-quality image that matches the design of the page. Also, this photo, in my opinion, better represents its purpose. In addition, it looks better in dark mode

</p>

#### 3. Social network icons in the page footer of the given template are not centered properly
